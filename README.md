Huzaifa: I implemented the Calendar page. On this page there is a calendar from which users looking to book an appointment can select a date on which they wish to book their appointment. On the right hand side a block allows you to select a time on the day selected on the calendar. Here you can select a time and submit a request to schedule an appointment for the given day and time.
